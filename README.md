# ü™êMidnight Mars (dev)
A simple, deep purple theme inspired by midnight on Mars.

![Preview](./Previews/FullPreview.png)

### NOTE: This theme is still kinda in-dev, I plan on changing/adding more stuff, also some things may be whacky so please make an issue request if you notice anything <3

# Installation & Updating
Let's get to the chase, you want this them, I know it, you know it. For installation, go to **Themes -> Open a CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash** in the folder, and enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuckFire/Midnight-Mars
```

Since Powercord's updater is currently broken, you have to update the theme manually. In order to do this, go to **Themes -> Midnight-Mars -> Open a CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash** in the folder, and enter the following:
```
git pull
```

# Customization
There are plenty of addons that come with the theme, if there are some that you don't like, you can easily remove them by opening the index.scss file and removing the ones that you dislike. If you'd like to submit an addon for everyone to use, make a pull request in the addons folder adding it!
